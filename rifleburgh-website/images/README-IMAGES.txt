IMPORTANT:
- The file names MUST match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Recommended: Resize images to approximately 800x600px or similar
- Compress images to reduce file size (aim for under 200KB each)
- Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp

TO ADD YOUR IMAGES:
1. Save/copy the 4 photos you shared to this folder
2. Rename them to match the names above
3. Refresh the website in your browser to see them

IMAGE OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
- Use online tools like TinyPNG.com or Squoosh.app to compress
- Larger images = slower page load times
- Target size: 100-300KB per image

If you want to use different names or add more images, edit the image src paths in index.html (search for "images/land-clearing-").
