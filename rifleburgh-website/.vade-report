# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the Rifenburgh Landscaping website.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
- **index.html** - Added Vercel Web Analytics script tags

## Implementation Details

Since this is a plain HTML website (not using a JavaScript framework like Next.js, React, Vue, etc.), I implemented the HTML-based approach as outlined in the Vercel Web Analytics documentation.

### What was added:
Added the following code snippet just before the closing `</head>` tag in index.html:

```html
<!-- Vercel Web Analytics -->
<script>
  window.va = window.va || function () { (window.vaq = window.vaq || []).push(arguments); };
</script>
<script defer src="/_vercel/insights/script.js"></script>
```

## How it works

1. The first script initializes the `window.va` function and creates a queue (`window.vaq`) to store analytics calls before the main script loads
2. The second script loads the Vercel analytics tracking script asynchronously using the `defer` attribute
3. Once deployed to Vercel with Web Analytics enabled in the dashboard, the script at `/_vercel/insights/script.js` will be automatically served
4. The analytics will start tracking page views and visitor data

## Next Steps

To complete the setup:

1. **Enable Web Analytics in Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to the Vercel dashboard
   - Select the Rifenburgh Landscaping project
   - Click the "Analytics" tab
   - Click "Enable" to activate Web Analytics

2. **Deploy the changes**:
   - Deploy this update to Vercel
   - The analytics routes will be available at `/_vercel/insights/*`

3. **Verify the implementation**:
   - After deployment, visit the website
   - Open browser Developer Tools → Network tab
   - Look for a Fetch/XHR request to `/_vercel/insights/view`
   - If the request appears, analytics is working correctly

4. **View analytics data**:
   - Return to the Vercel dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Click the "Analytics" tab
   - Data will start appearing after visitors access the site

## Notes

- No package installation was required since this is a plain HTML site (no npm/pnpm/yarn dependencies)
- The implementation uses the HTML script approach, which means there is no automatic route support, but it will track all page views
- The analytics script is loaded with the `defer` attribute, ensuring it doesn't block page rendering
- All visitor data is collected in compliance with privacy standards as documented by Vercel
