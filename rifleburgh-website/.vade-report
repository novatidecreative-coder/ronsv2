# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics tracking script across all HTML pages in the Rifenburgh Landscaping website.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
1. **index.html** - Main website page
2. **diagnose-admin.html** - Admin diagnostic tool page
3. **export-images.html** - Image export utility page
4. **test-admin.html** - Admin button test page

### Implementation Details:
Added the Vercel Web Analytics tracking script to the `<head>` section of all HTML files, just before the closing `</head>` tag.

The script includes:
- Initialization of the `window.va` tracking function
- Deferred loading of the Vercel insights script from `/_vercel/insights/script.js`

### Code Added:
```html
<!-- Vercel Web Analytics -->
<script>
  window.va = window.va || function () { (window.vaq = window.vaq || []).push(arguments); };
</script>
<script defer src="/_vercel/insights/script.js"></script>
```

## Implementation Approach

Since this is a plain HTML website (not using a JavaScript framework like Next.js, React, etc.), I followed the HTML-specific implementation instructions from the Vercel Web Analytics documentation:

- No npm package installation required for plain HTML sites
- Added the tracking script directly to all HTML files
- The script will automatically track page views once the site is deployed to Vercel

## Notes

- The analytics will only start collecting data after the site is deployed to Vercel with Web Analytics enabled in the dashboard
- The script uses a deferred loading strategy to minimize impact on page load performance
- Once deployed, a network request to `/_vercel/insights/view` should be visible in the browser's Network tab
- No route tracking is available for plain HTML implementations (this would require a JavaScript framework)

## Next Steps

To complete the Vercel Web Analytics setup:
1. Deploy the updated site to Vercel
2. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Analytics tab → Enable)
3. Verify tracking by checking for `/_vercel/insights/view` requests in browser Network tab
4. View analytics data in the Vercel dashboard after deployment

## Testing
The changes have been verified by:
- Confirming all 4 HTML files were modified correctly
- Reviewing git diff to ensure only the analytics script was added
- Ensuring the script placement is consistent across all files
- Verifying no other code was modified or affected
